# Analysis of Barron's 2013 Rankings with College Scorecard Data

_Enhanced with Best Representative Methodology and Comprehensive Summary Statistics_

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines 11 distinct categories from Barron's 2013 college rankings, enriched with current data from the College Scorecard. Each category profile includes:

- **Summary statistics** across all institutions in the category (median, 25th-75th percentile)
- **One representative institution** selected using a median-proximity algorithm
- **Comprehensive test score data** including both SAT and ACT when available
- **Verified institutional metrics** from the U.S. Department of Education

### Selection Methodology

Representative institutions were selected using a **'Best Representative'** approach:
- For each category, we calculated the median SAT score and median admission rate
- We then selected the institution whose metrics are closest to these medians
- This provides a more typical example than alphabetical or random selection
- Distance was calculated using normalized Euclidean distance to fairly weight both metrics

### Test Score Data Note

Test score reporting varies significantly by category:
- **Most competitive schools**: 94.4% report SAT data
- **Specialized programs**: Only 21.6% report SAT (use portfolios/auditions instead)
- **Noncompetitive schools**: Only 32.9% report SAT (many are test-optional)
- We show both SAT and ACT scores when available to maximize data completeness

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Data Sources
* **Barron's Rankings**: `barrons_2013and2019.csv` - Historical college selectivity rankings
* **Institutional Data**: College Scorecard most recent cohorts (U.S. Department of Education)
* **Data Dictionary**: `college_scorecard_limited_variables_data_dictionary.csv`

### Matching and Selection
* **Institution Matching**: Matched by IPEDS Unit ID (unitid) for accuracy
* **Representative Selection**: For each category, selected the institution whose SAT score and admission rate are closest to the category median (using normalized Euclidean distance)
* **Test Score Composite**: Used `sat_avg` when available; calculated from reading + math midpoints otherwise; showed ACT scores as additional reference

### Data Completeness Considerations
* Test score reporting varies by selectivity level and institutional type
* Many less competitive and specialized institutions are test-optional
* Overall coverage: 70.7% have SAT data, 58.6% have ACT data, 71.1% have either
* "Data not reported" indicates the institution did not report that metric to the Department of Education

### Analysis Date
* Barron's rankings: 2013
* College Scorecard data: Most recent cohorts available in dataset
* Analysis conducted: November 2025
