# Analysis of Barron's 2013 Rankings with College Scorecard Data

_Enhanced with Best Representative Methodology and Complete Institutional Coverage_

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines **all 6,429 U.S. higher education institutions** in the College Scorecard database, categorized by their Barron's 2013 selectivity rankings where available.

### Key Findings

- **1,384 institutions (21.5%)** have Barron's 2013 rankings
- **5,045 institutions (78.5%)** were not ranked by Barron's ("No category")
- The "No category" group is predominantly community colleges, vocational schools, and specialized institutions
- Data completeness varies dramatically: 94% of elite schools report SAT vs. 3% of unranked schools

### Why is "No category" so large?

Barron's 2013 rankings focused on traditional 4-year institutions. The unranked group includes:
- **Community colleges** (2-year institutions)
- **For-profit institutions** and career colleges
- **Vocational and technical schools**
- **Very small or newly established** institutions
- **Specialized certificate programs**
- **Branch campuses** not individually ranked

### Selection Methodology

Representative institutions were selected using a **'Best Representative'** approach:
- Calculated median SAT score and admission rate for each category
- Selected the institution closest to these medians (normalized Euclidean distance)
- For "No category", prioritized institutions with available data

### Test Score Data Completeness

| Category | SAT Reporting | Explanation |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Most competitive | 94.4% | Nearly universal reporting |
| VC/C categories | 60-90% | Most require standardized tests |
| Specialized programs | 26.2% | Portfolio/audition-based admissions |
| No category | 3.4% | Mostly community colleges (test-optional) |
