Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions),cost,attendance.academic_year,integer,,COSTT4_A,,,IPEDS,,"The average annual total cost of attendance, including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution, and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LPROGRAM), this represents the cost for the full program.",,,,1

Prior to the 2011-12 academic year, when months worked were reported in groups, the value for 9-10 months is estimated as 9.5 months and the value for 11-12 months is estimated as 11.5 months. Values prior to the 2003-04 academic year are limited to degree-granting institutions for consistency with values in subsequent academic years.",,,,1
Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant,aid,pell_grant_rate,float,,PCTPELL,,,IPEDS,,"The proportion of undergraduates who received a Pell grant in the academic year, calculated from the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component.

Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. This metric is not available prior to the 2008-09 academic year.",,,,1
