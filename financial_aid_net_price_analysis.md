# Financial Aid and Net Price Analysis by Barron's Selectivity Category

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes financial aid patterns, net prices, and student outcomes across college selectivity tiers using Barron's 2013 rankings matched to College Scorecard data.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Most competitive schools provide the most generous aid to low-income students**: Median net price of $8,865 for families earning $0-30k, compared to $49,113 for families earning $110k+. This represents a 5.5x difference, demonstrating highly progressive pricing.

2. **Middle-tier schools show less progressive pricing**: Schools in the C/C+/VC tiers charge low-income students $14,906-$16,532 (median) while charging high-income students $23,955-$27,449, only a 1.5-1.7x difference.

3. **Pell student retention correlates strongly with selectivity**: At most competitive schools, 73.6% of Pell students remain enrolled after 2 years with only 7.9% withdrawing. At noncompetitive (NC) schools, only 27.7% remain enrolled with 29.1% withdrawing.

4. **No category institutions serve a different population**: These 4,765 institutions (mostly community colleges and vocational programs) show 25.7% completion at 2 years (certificate programs complete faster) but 39.4% withdrawal rates, and relatively flat pricing across income brackets ($13,965-$19,174).

5. **Specialized programs are expensive across all income levels**: Median net price ranges from $27,585 (low-income) to $38,839 (high-income), with less progressive pricing than ranked institutions.

## 1. Overall Net Price by Selectivity Category

Average net price after all grant aid (Title IV institutions):

| Category | Total Institutions | Data Coverage | Median Net Price | Mean Net Price | 25th-75th Percentile |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Most competitive | 89 | 86 (96.6%) | $28,466 | $28,252 | $21,119 - $34,890 |

| Specialized programs | 65 | 57 (87.7%) | $34,725 | $32,662 | $20,799 - $42,448 |
| No category | 4,765 | 3,804 (79.8%) | $15,071 | $16,104 | $8,652 - $21,769 |

**Interpretation:** Most competitive schools have higher median net prices than middle-tier schools, but this masks significant variation by income level (see next section). The lowest net prices are at NC and No category institutions.

| No category | $13,965 | $13,624 | $14,941 | $16,925 | $19,174 |

**Key Insights:**

- **Progressive pricing at top schools**: Most competitive institutions charge low-income students (median $8,865) far less than high-income students ($49,113), a $40k difference.

- **Flatter pricing at middle tiers**: VC through C category schools show much less variation by income, typically $14-16k for low-income vs $24-28k for high-income.

- **Affordable options exist across income levels**: NC and No category institutions charge $11,436-$13,965 for low-income students, providing crucial access.

- **High-income families pay more everywhere**: Even at No category schools, high-income families pay $19,174 median (vs $13,965 for low-income), though the absolute difference is smaller.

## 3. Pell Student Outcomes (2-Year Tracking)

What happened to Pell Grant recipients 2 years after entry:

| Category | Completion Rate | Still Enrolled | Withdrawal Rate | Data Coverage |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Most competitive | 9.9% | 73.6% | 7.9% | 82/89 |
| HC+ | 13.3% | 65.2% | 8.6% | 34/37 |
| HC | 14.8% | 58.3% | 9.7% | 66/68 |
| VC+ | 12.1% | 51.6% | 12.2% | 54/55 |
| VC | 13.7% | 46.6% | 14.2% | 207/213 |
| C+ | 13.5% | 41.0% | 17.3% | 67/70 |
| C | 15.0% | 36.9% | 19.5% | 557/574 |
| LC | 13.9% | 32.7% | 24.5% | 132/151 |
| NC | 14.2% | 27.7% | 29.1% | 50/62 |
| Specialized programs | 19.7% | 47.5% | 23.8% | 46/65 |
| No category | 25.7% | 15.1% | 39.4% | 1134/4765 |

**Key Findings:**

- **Retention strongly correlates with selectivity**: Most competitive schools retain 73.6% of Pell students at 2 years (vs 27.7% at NC schools).

- **Lower withdrawal at selective schools**: Most competitive schools see 7.9% withdrawal vs 29.1% at NC schools - a nearly 4x difference.

- **No category completions are higher but misleading**: 25.7% completion reflects certificate/vocational programs that can finish in 2 years, unlike 4-year bachelor's programs. However, withdrawal rates are also highest (39.4%).

- **Specialized programs show mixed results**: 19.7% completion, 47.5% still enrolled, 23.8% withdrawal - reflecting diverse program types (arts conservatories, technical schools, etc.).

- **Data availability varies**: Privacy suppression affects smaller schools and cohorts, particularly at most competitive institutions (39% coverage for completion vs 92% for enrollment).

**Pell Outcomes:**
- Tracked 2 years after entry to original institution
- Completion: Earned credential/degree within 2 years
- Still Enrolled: Remained at original institution after 2 years
- Withdrawal: Left without completing
- Privacy suppressed data excluded from analysis

**Categories:**
- Most competitive through NC: Barron's selectivity ratings
