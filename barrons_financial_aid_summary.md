## Methodology

**Data Sources:**
- Barron's Profiles of American Colleges (2013, 29th edition)
- U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard
- 6,149 undergraduate institutions (excludes 280 graduate-only programs)

**Weighting:**
All statistics are weighted by undergraduate enrollment (UGDS), so larger institutions have proportionally greater influence on the means. This approach reflects the typical student experience rather than the typical institution.

**Variables:**
- Pell Rate: % of undergraduates receiving Pell grants (AY 2022-23)
- Loan Rate: % receiving federal loans (AY 2022-23)
- Net Price: Cost of attendance minus all grant aid (AY 2022-23)
- Income brackets: $0-30k, $30-48k, $48-75k, $75-110k, $110k+
