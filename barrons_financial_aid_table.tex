\textit{Notes:} This table presents median values across institutions within each Barron's selectivity category. 
N indicates the number of institutions in each category. Undergrads shows total undergraduate enrollment summed across all institutions. 
Aid rates are percentages. Net price represents the average annual cost of attendance after all grant aid 
(federal, state, and institutional), reported separately by family income level.

\textit{Data Sources:} College selectivity categories from \textit{Barron's Profiles of American Colleges} (2013). 
Financial aid and net price data from U.S.\ Department of Education College Scorecard, accessed via 
\url{https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data}. Sample includes 6,149 undergraduate-degree-granting institutions.

\textit{Variable Definitions and Cohorts:} 
\textbf{Pell Rate} (PCTPELL): Proportion of undergraduates receiving Pell grants (Academic Year 2022--23, IPEDS). 
\textbf{Loan Rate} (PCTFLOAN): Proportion of undergraduates receiving federal student loans (Academic Year 2022--23, IPEDS). 
\textbf{Net Price} (NPT4\_PUB, NPT4\_PRIV): Average annual total cost of attendance minus average grant/scholarship aid 
for full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates receiving Title IV aid (Academic Year 2022--23, IPEDS). 
For public institutions, limited to students paying in-state tuition. 
\textbf{Income-Specific Net Price} (NPT41--45\_PUB, NPT41--45\_PRIV): Net price calculated separately for five family income brackets: 
\$0--30,000; \$30,001--48,000; \$48,001--75,000; \$75,001--110,000; \$110,001 or more (Academic Year 2022--23, IPEDS). 
Income categories based on values used by institutions to calculate financial aid eligibility. 
For dependent students, includes student's and parents' income; for independent students, includes student's adjusted gross income 
and spouse's income if married. 
\textbf{Undergraduate Enrollment} (UGDS): Enrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students (Fall 2023, IPEDS).

\textit{Categories:} Most competitive through NC (Noncompetitive) represent Barron's nine selectivity ratings. 
``Specialized programs'' includes arts conservatories, military academies, and specialized professional schools rated separately by Barron's. 
``No category'' includes 4,765 institutions (78.5\% of sample) not included in Barron's 2013 ratings, 
primarily community colleges, vocational schools, and other non-selective institutions.
